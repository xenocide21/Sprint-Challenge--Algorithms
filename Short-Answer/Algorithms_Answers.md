#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The time complexity is O(n) because it running a single loop

b)
This is a loop that run until we reach whatever value n is. It's 0(n)

c)
This is a loop the calls itself until we hit 0. It's 0(n)
## Exercise II

Find the midpoint of the building and drop an egg. If it breaks find the midpoint from that floor to the bottom. Drop an egg. If it breaks repeat, if it doesn't break find the midpoint from that floor to the orginal midpoint. Continue this pattern until you find the lowest floor it doesn't break on. It's O(log n)
